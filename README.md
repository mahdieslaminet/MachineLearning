# MachineLearning 
## This is a complete booklet for machine learning, in the first part we get to know the basic concepts, then enter statistics and probability
## In the next step, we will get to know the main Python libraries like numpy and pandas in a general way
## And in the last step, we process famous datasets and implement machine learning algorithms on them
## This project was carried out in collaboration with Dr. Mehdi Eslami and Engineer Pooria Ziarati
